# CONTRIBUTING

This guide is for anyone who wants to contribute to the jobby project.

## Working on an issue

IMPORTANT: Before working on a PR, please open an issue and discuss your
intended changes. Maintainers may be able to provide valuable information and
point you in the right direction to get the most out of your contribution. If
you send a PR totally out of the blue there is a chance that it will not get
accepted.

### Branches

All `issue` branches should be branched from `main` branch unless you're
working on an issue that belongs to one of our special projects. In that
case, a project branch will be specified. If you're unsure about the branch
don't hesitate to reach out.

### Workflow

- create an issue branch
- commit your changes
- open a PR
- try to keep your PRs small in scope (only 1 issue at a time please)
- you can add as many commits as you wish to your PR

### Commit messages

We are currently following the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Pull Requests (PRs)

When submitting a PR, please do not leave the PR title / body incomplete or
empty. As an open-source project we may (hopefully) have other people
contributing, so the aim is to maintain a certain level of professionalism.

Try to make your PRs as informative as possible

- link the related issue you are solving
- add some info about how you've resolved the issue
- if applicable, attach an image as well
